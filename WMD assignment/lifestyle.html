	<h1 class="thicker">Eiffel tower</h1>
<img src="Images/Eiffel tower.JPG" alt="Eiffel tower" width="625" height="300">
<p class="thicker">Built for the World Fair in 1889, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest tower in the world until overtaken by the Chrysler Building in the 1930's.
 The tower is 324m high and was designed by engineer Gustave Eiffels and nicknamed La dame de fer, which means the iron lady.
 The Eiffel tower opens 7 days a week, visitors can earn the fabulous view by climbing the stairs or taking the elevator. In order to avoid the gigantic queues it is best to arrive early (9am) or late as the sun is going down. 
 The Champ de Mars is a lovely place to lounge, eat a picnic and enjoy the incredible perspectives.</p>

<h1 class="thicker">Notre Dame</h1>

<img src="Images/Notre Dame.JPG" alt="Notre Dame" width="300" height="300">, <img src="Images/Notre Dame2.JPG" alt="Notre Dame2" width="300" height="300">

<p class="thicker">Notre Dame de Paris is the most visited site in Paris, with over 10 million visitors a year. 
It was built on a site occupied by earlier churches in 1160 by a Bishop called Maurice de Sully. The cathedral was completed in the 14th century by architect Viollet-le Ducan. These days it is hard not to stand in open-mouthed awe as you enter through the majestic doors. 
It has a spectacular view of Paris as well as some rather impressive gargoyles and the 13 tone bell Emmanuel.Notre Dame is open daily from 8am to 6.45pm. The cathedral is free to enter but there is a small charge to climb the towers. 
The opening hours of the towers change depending on the season. Down the stairs is the Crypte Archéologique, Notre Dame's archaeological museum.</p>


<h1 class="thicker">Louvre</h1>
<img src="Images/Louvre1.JPG" alt="Louvre" width="625" height="300">

<p class="thicker">Le Musée du Louvre is the world's largest museum and the most visited in the world. It is unsurpassed in terms of its collection of Western art from the Middle Ages to about 1848. The 'Grand Louvre' project pioneered by President Mitterand in 1989 doubled the museum's exhibition space and today it contains some 35,000 objets d'art.
 It would take nine months to see all that the Louvre has to offer, so choose a specific department or time period and focus on that.
 To avoid the big queues, try and get there early and head straight for the Mona Lisa. If not, the Louvre is open late on Wednesday and Friday nights and it is always much quieter then. There are pretty snazzy multimedia guides available for each wing.</p>


<h1 class="thicker">Arc de Triomphe</h1>
<img src="Images/Arc de Triomphe.JPG" alt="Arc de Triomphe" width="300" height="300">, <img src="Images/Arc de Triomphe1.JPG" alt="Arc de Triomphe" width="300" height="300">

<p class="thicker">The Arc de Triomphe stands majestically at the center of its own star, in the closet thing that secular France has to sacred ground. The memorial honors the 1.5 million Frenchmen who died during WW1. On August 26, 1944 he relit the eternal flame that burns there after a legendary triumphant march through Paris. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, illuminated by an eternal flame (that de Gaulle relit), is situated under the arch. The flame is rekindled every evening at 6:30, which is the most atmospheric time to visit. 
It is well worth the 40-step climb which rewards you with stunning views of the Champsées.A permanent exhibition that charts the tumultuous history of the Arc de Triomphe as well as other famous arches throughout Europe. The Koreans built there own arch at the foot of Moran Hill in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang. 
Their arch, which honors President Kim Il-sung's role in the resistance against Japanese rule, was modeled on its Parisian counterpart.</p>

<h1 class="thicker">Centre Pompidou</h1>
<img src="Images/Centre Pompidou.JPG" alt="Centre Pompidou" width="625" height="300">
<p class="thicker">Centre Pompidou is a light house for the cutting edge of modern art. Second in the world only to New York's MoMA. Opened in 1977 after a competition was won by the then-unknown Renzo Piano. The Centre was designed to accommodate 5000 visitors a day, but now attracts over 20,000 daily. 
It is full of colorful sculptures, such as mermaids, elephants, giant red lips and bowler hats that have be known to squirt water at passers by.</p>

<h1 class="thicker">Musée d’Orsay</h1>
<img src="Images/Musée d’Orsay.JPG" alt="Musée d’Orsay" width="625" height="300">
<p class="thicker">The Musée d'Orsay houses the French national collection of art from 1848 to 1914. The museum's collection includes a variety of art, from painting to photography, from sculptures to decorative arts. The building was constructed for the 1900 World Fair, though it's industrial purpose was concealed by its architect Victor Laloux with materials such as glass and stucco. 
The floor above is a role call of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movers and shakers: Monet, Manet, Seurat, Van Gogh, and Degas (his famed dancers and prostitutes are a highlight).Book ahead on the website or buy a Museum Pass to avoid long queues. The Guide to the Musée d'Orsay by Caroline Mathieu is worth the splurge. The Restaurant du Musée is worth a look on its own merit.</p>


<h1 class="thicker">Disneyland Paris</h1>
<img src="Images/Disneyland Paris.JPG" alt="Disneyland Paris " width="325" height="300">, <img src="Images/Disneyland Paris1.JPG" alt="Disneyland Paris" width="350" height="300">
<p class="thicker">Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 and is one of Europe's biggest tourist attractions. Main Street U.S.A. recreates the 20th-century charm of small-town America in all its white picket fence glory. In Walt Disney Studios Park you can experience the showbiz world and get a feel of how Disney films are made. There is even a Disney Golf course and a Disney Lake to keep you amused. It's easy to get to Disneyland Paris by train and the last train back to Paris leaves at 12:20am. 
 Eurostar trains now run directly between St Pancras and Disneyland Paris.</p>

<h1 class="thicker">Hotel des Invalides</h1>
<img src="Images/Hotel des Invalides.JPG" alt="Hotel des Invalides" width="625" height="300">
<p class="thicker">Hotel des Invalides is Paris' largest single collection of monuments, made up of 4 museums and 2 churches. Napoléon Bonaparte's tomb lies under the towering golden dome of the Eglise du Dôme. Musée de l'Armée is in effect several museums in one, including a replica of Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The Hotel des In Valides was built in 1670 by Louis XIV to house wounded soldiers, and at one time housed 6,000 invalids. Napoleon's tomb was moved here in 1840 from the island of Saint Helena and is guarded by six coffins.

The Esplanade des Invalides is a favorite spot for ball games and Frisbee games. Use the southern entrance, on Place Vauban (Avenue de Tourville) Napoléon's Tomb is just around the corner.</p>


<h1 class="thicker">Sacre-Coeur</h1>
<img src="Images/Sacre-Coeur.JPG" alt="Sacre-Coeur" width="300" height="300">, <img src="Images/Sacre-Coeur1.JPG" alt="Sacre-Coeur1" width="300" height="300">
<p class="thicker">Sacre-Coeur sits majestically atop the arty district of Montmartre, surveying the city of Paris. The basilica was built between 1870 and 1919, by the French government as a symbol of the return of self-confidence after the devastating years of the Commune. The largest and most eye-catching mosaic was created in 1922 by Luc-Olivier Merson. The one and only La Savoyarde, weighing in at an impressive 19 tons, is the one and a half times the size of the average American football field. 
The massive golden mosaic set high above the choir is definitely worthy of some awed gazing.</p>

<h1 class="thicker">Provins</h1>
<img src="Images/Provins.JPG" alt="" width="625" height="300"
<p class="thicker">Provins was one of four host towns for many "Champagne Fairs" that took place in the 12th and 13th centuries. The fairs were vital for the French economy, and indeed the economy of Europe. Caesar's Tower commands impressive views of the surrounding countryside. The Tithe Barn is now a museum dedicated to the Champagne fairs and offers an insight into medieval Provins. The town was awarded UNESCO heritage status for "maintaining its original medieval fabric" in 2001 and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Provins has a 12th century house that hosts the Provins Museum. Almost every day from April to November there are Medieval themed shows. The town is notorious for a web of underground tunnels used by secret societies. The city is also home to the French National Gallery and the Musée de Proximity. The SNCF regional train from Gare de l'Est to Provins takes just over an hour.</p>
